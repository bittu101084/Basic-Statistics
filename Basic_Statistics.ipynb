        "Everyone's favorite example of interval data is temperatures in degrees celsius. 20 degrees C is warmer than 10, and the difference between 20 degrees and 10 degrees is 10 degrees. The difference between 10 and 0 is also 10 degrees.\n",

        "Example: Consider test scores: 85, 90, 88, 92, 84. The mean score would be: $$\\text{Mean} = \\frac{85 + 90 + 88 + 92 + 84}{5} = 87.8.$$\n",

        "\n",
        "Median\n",
        "The median is the middle value in a data set when ordered from least to greatest. If there's an even number of values, it’s the average of the two middle ones.\n",

        "\n",
        "> Dispersion refers to the degree to which data values are spread out or scattered around a central value (like the mean). It provides insights into the variability or consistency of the data. In other words, dispersion helps us understand whether the data points are closely packed together or widely spaced apart.\n",

        "\n",
        "Variance\n",
        "Variance measures the average squared difference between each data point and the mean. By squaring the differences, it ensures all deviations (whether above or below the mean) are considered positive, and it emphasizes larger deviations more heavily.\n",

        "\n",
        "> A box plot (also called a box-and-whisker plot) is a graphical representation used to summarize the distribution of a data set. It displays the data's central tendency, variability, and outliers at a glance.\n",
        "\n",
        "Key Components of a Box Plot:\n",
        "Median (Q2): The middle value of the data set, dividing it into two halves. It's shown as a line inside the box.\n",
        "\n",
        "First Quartile (Q1): The median of the lower half of the data (25th percentile).\n",
        "\n",
        "Third Quartile (Q3): The median of the upper half of the data (75th percentile).\n",
        "\n",
        "Interquartile Range (IQR): The range between Q1 and Q3 (𝐼𝑄𝑅=𝑄3-𝑄1). It represents the middle 50% of the data.\n",
        "\n",
        "Whiskers: Lines extending from the box to the smallest and largest data points within 1.5×𝐼𝑄𝑅. They show the spread of most of the data.\n",
        "\n",
        "Outliers: Individual points plotted beyond the whiskers, representing unusually large or small values.\n",
        "\n",
        "5.  Discuss the role of random sampling in making inferences about populations.\n",
        "\n",
        "> Random sampling is a method of selecting a subset (or sample) from a larger population in such a way that each individual or item in the population has an equal chance of being chosen. This ensures the sample is representative of the population, minimizing bias.\n",
        "\n",
        "Why Is It Important for Inferences?\n",
        "Representative Samples: Random sampling helps ensure that the sample accurately reflects the diversity and characteristics of the entire population. Without it, conclusions drawn may not apply to the population as a whole.\n",
        "\n",
        "Reduces Bias: By giving each member of the population an equal probability of being included, random sampling eliminates systematic favoritism or bias, providing more valid results.\n",
        "\n",
        "Statistical Accuracy: Inferences made using random samples are more reliable. Techniques like confidence intervals and hypothesis testing assume randomness to calculate probabilities and margins of error.\n",
        "\n",
        "Generalization: Random sampling allows researchers to generalize findings from the sample to the entire population. This is crucial in fields like medicine, social sciences, and market research.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. Explain the concept of skewness and its types. How does skewness affect the interpretation of data?\n",
        "\n",
        "> Skewness is a measure of the asymmetry in the distribution of data around its mean. While symmetric data has a balanced shape, skewed data shows more values concentrated on one side, leading to a \"lean\" in the distribution. Skewness helps describe the shape and direction of this lean.\n",
        "\n",
        "Types of Skewness\n",
        "Positive Skew (Right-Skewed):\n",
        "\n",
        "The tail of the distribution extends more to the right (toward larger values).\n",
        "\n",
        "The mean is greater than the median because extreme high values pull the mean up.\n",
        "\n",
        "Example: Income distribution in many countries, where most people earn less, but a few high-income individuals skew the data.\n",
        "\n",
        "Negative Skew (Left-Skewed):\n",
        "\n",
        "The tail of the distribution extends more to the left (toward smaller values).\n",
        "\n",
        "The mean is less than the median due to the influence of extreme low values.\n",
        "\n",
        "Example: Time taken to complete a task in an assembly line, where most workers finish quickly, but a few take longer.\n",
        "\n",
        "Symmetrical Distribution:\n",
        "\n",
        "No skewness—data is evenly distributed around the mean.\n",
        "\n",
        "The mean, median, and mode are approximately equal.\n",
        "\n",
        "Example: Heights of people in a large group (often approximately symmetric).\n",

        "7. What is the interquartile range (IQR), and how is it used to detect outliers?\n",
        "\n",
        "> The interquartile range (IQR) is a measure of statistical dispersion that represents the range within which the middle 50% of the data falls. It is calculated as the difference between the third quartile (Q3) and the first quartile (Q1):\n",
        "\n",
        "IQR=𝑄3−𝑄1\n",
        "\n",
        "How IQR Works in Detecting Outliers\n",
        "Outliers are data points that fall significantly outside the overall pattern of the data. IQR is a key tool for identifying such values.\n",

        "Determine IQR:\n",
        "\n",
        "Calculate Q1 (25th percentile) and Q3 (75th percentile).\n",

        "\n",
        "> The binomial distribution is a discrete probability distribution that applies to scenarios where there are exactly two possible outcomes (commonly referred to as \"success\" and \"failure\") for each trial of an experiment. Here are the key conditions under which the binomial distribution is used:\n",

        "Each trial must result in one of two mutually exclusive outcomes: success or failure.\n",
